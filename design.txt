Design Considerations:

With scalability in mind, a React Router is used to enable additional pages to be added when needed.
Reusability of components is focused on as well as abstraction for readability and cleaner code. 

Explanation of file structure ->

1. API: 

All API calls which do not use react hooks are put here. Local storage is used to store Auth token for future use.

2. Components:

Components are made to be reusable by passing in the necessary props to change their behaviours.

3. Functions:

Stateless pure functions which can be easily used anywhere and also tested.

4. Hooks:

Custom hooks to abstract out API calls that need to be called based on dependencies.

5. Interfaces:

Various Interfaces exported to define data returned from API calls.
